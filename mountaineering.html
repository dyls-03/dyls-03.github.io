  <h1>My Journey</h1>
  <p>As a child, I hated walking and hiking believe it or not (just ask my parents).
    I remember my first trip to the Lake District, I complained the whole time.
  </p>
  <p>Although I had been bouldering a couple times with some mates, and did the Trinnacle Hike near Manchester with a good friend of mine a month prior, I like to think my journey starts really starts 27th September. 
    After a breakup of a 3 year long relationship, I realised I was too comfortable and settled at home. I was too okay with being cooped up in my room all day, waking up late and gaming until 3am. A change was needed, a rewiring of my brain was required.
    So every weekend I'd try to do something that required me to leave my house, these were the start of my "Side Quests", and this all eventually led to September 26th where I found myself driving to North Wales a day after moving into my university accomodation, destination: Eryri National Park AKA Snowdonia.
    The following day I woke up and tackled Snowdon, my first mountain, and I foolishly decided to take the hardest route despite no mountaineering experience: Crib Goch (the best decision I have ever made), this was to be my first scramble. 
    This was probably the first time I felt like I was going to die not only because of the steep exposure, but also because of the chossy scrambling and the borderline unroped rock climbing (possibly due to me going off route, oops). 
    I loved that feeling, and I loved that whole experience. I realised I was in love with adrenaline and a week later I found myself in front of Loughborough's mountaineering society's stall at the society's bazaar asking how to join.
  </p>
  <p>Enter LSMC - Loughborough Students Mountaineering Club, a club filled with some of the greatest people I have ever met and a club that has had such a profound effect and imparted so many new skills on me all within the short timespan of less than a year.
    I went from a introverted kid who could just climb V2 boulders indoors, to using V3s as warm ups, smashing out V4s, and even sending a V6 (it might have been a little soft) towards the end of the year, and thats just bouldering.
    From there I also learnt how to Top Rope and belay, lead and clean sport routes and lead belay, both indoor and outdoor. The natural progression from there was to trad climbing. Now that will get your heart pumping.
    I seconded 2 routes and then someone decided to send me up a hard V Diff as my first trad lead. Someone shit my pants that day and I'm still trying to figure out who. I spent a whole hour on that climb, I was scared shitless, but it was so much fun.
    Next came an ice skills course where I learnt how to use crampons and ice axes. Then came a rope skills course which helped improve my trad skills as well as setting up anchors. 
    All these courses and skills must have caugh the committee's eye as they decided to award me Gore's Gollock, a real British Army Ghurka knife that's used as an LSMC award. 
    Top Rope Solo skills were the last thing emparted onto me by the chair of the club.
