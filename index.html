    <h1>Welcome to PROJECT: MIDAS</h1>
    <h2>What is Project Midas?</h2>
    <p>MidasWWW (or Midas) for short is one of the earliest web browsers developed at the Standford Linear Accelerator Center, after the release of Berners-Lee's WWw software and library for web development 
      (or more simply put the start of the World Wide Web). As this is a project to develop my first personal professional website, the name I think is quite self explanatory</p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Dylan Val</p>


    <p>I've been to to some of the highest of highs from the Shard to Burj Khalifa and Mauna Kea, but I can still go higher.</p>  
    <p>I've been down deep from SCUBA diving to submarines, but I can still go deeper</p>
    <p>Below are the places in the world that I've explored, but I've still got a lot more exploring to do</p>
